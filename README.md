This repository is for reproduction of simulation results for the work titled "Latency Optimization for Wireless Federated Learning in Multihop Networks".
The simulation is done in MATLAB platform.
Overall_Latency.m is the file for the combined optimization of leaf and relay nodes.
Sub1_Three_of_one.m and Sub2_Three_of_two.m are the files for only leaf and only relay nodes optimization, respectively.
